## Customer Reviews Analysis

### Project Overview

This project involves scraping customer reviews from the British Airways website, followed by data preprocessing and sentiment analysis. The main goal is to understand customer sentiments and identify key areas of improvement for British Airways.

### Key Steps
- **Web Scraping:** Using Python's `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to scrape customer reviews from multiple pages.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the text data by removing special characters, tokenization, stop words removal, and stemming.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify the sentiment of reviews.
- **Modeling:** Training a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment based on review text.

### Results
- The sentiment analysis revealed common themes and sentiments expressed by customers, providing actionable insights for British Airways to enhance customer satisfaction.

### Business Recommendations
- **Improve Customer Experience:** Focus on addressing the most common complaints identified in the reviews.
- **Customer Feedback System:** Implement a more robust feedback system to capture and act on customer sentiments in real-time.

## Customer Bookings Prediction

### Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will complete a booking based on historical booking data. The goal is to help businesses identify high-probability customers and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

### Key Steps
- **Data Exploration:** Analyzing and visualizing the dataset to understand its structure and key variables.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Converting categorical variables into numerical ones and handling missing data.
- **Feature Selection:** Using Mutual Information to identify the most significant features affecting the booking completion.
- **Modeling:** Training machine learning models to predict booking completion, with a focus on model accuracy and interpretability.

### Results
- The analysis identified key factors influencing customer booking behavior, enabling more targeted marketing efforts and operational improvements.

### Business Recommendations
- **Targeted Marketing:** Use the model to identify and focus on customers who are more likely to complete bookings.
- **Improve Conversion Rates:** Implement strategies to address common reasons for booking abandonment identified in the analysis.

## Conclusion

These projects demonstrate the application of data science techniques to real-world business problems. By leveraging web scraping, NLP, and machine learning, businesses can gain valuable insights and improve decision-making processes.
